## Hugo Theme Stack Starter Template

This is a quick start template for [Hugo theme Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack). It uses [Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) feature to load the theme.

It comes with a basic theme structure and configuration. GitHub action has been set up to deploy the theme to a public GitHub page automatically. Also, there's a cron job to update the theme automatically everyday.

To get started:

1. Click *Use this template*, and create your repository on GitHub.

2. Once the repository is created, create a GitHub codespace asociated with it.

3. And voila! You're ready to go. The codespace has been configured with the latest version of Hugo extended, just run `hugo server` in the terminal and see your new site in action.

4. Check `config` folder for the configuration files. You can edit them to suit your needs. Make sure to update the `baseurl` property in `config/_default/config.toml` to your site's URL.

5. Once you're done editing the site, just commit it and push it. GitHub action will deploy the site automatically to GitHub page asociated with the repository.

In case you don't want to use GitHub codespace, you can also run this template in your local machine. **You need to install Git, Go and Hugo extended locally.**

### Update theme manually

Run:

```bash
hugo mod get -u github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/v3
hugo mod tidy
```

> This starter template has been configured with `v3` version of theme. Due to the limitation of Go module, once the `v4` or up version of theme is released, you need to update the theme manually. (Modifying `config/module.toml` file)

### Deploy to another static page hostings

If you want to build this site using another static page hosting, you need to make sure they have Go installed in the machine.
